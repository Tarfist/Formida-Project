# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

Welcome to Formida-Project's Beginning Guide, I hope you find thids Index helpful and something you'd come back to for finding new things.

The list goes on and so must we, That is why it's important to have an index that'll be update time to time and give those who're having problems a chance to correct their mistakes when they enter the world of tinkering.

We are just make the most out of our devices, Thats about all.

::: warning Regarding Pages
Currently, All the pages you see within the sidebar are empty and do not head to anywhere.

That is because this whole website is still in development, Not everything is final thus you have to wait.

For now, You can check the [Github](https://github.com/Tarfist/Formida-Project) Repo for more information and do suggest the guides or information you would like to see in here.
