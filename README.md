# ‚≠êIntroducing Formida

An index full of useful things that only a person who wants to take advantage of their things and get the most out of them will find awesome.

From helping you with things related to PS4 homebrew to running custom ROMs on your Android.

The list improves over time and is open for review, suggestion, and issue reporting.

Also, if it wasn't obvious by now, it's my first open source project ever, and so I'd appreciate anyone giving advice on this project to improve it and make it work for everyone.

## Current Status

This project is pretty much in its infancy, so don't expect everything to be filled in.

Many guides and things will come slowly with time, but I have to remind because it might become a problem in the future.

## üìíNote

Most of the posts will be published because I have relevant experience. If you don't have experience writing about the field, there is no point.

Don't worry. As time goes on, this will change. It's just a heads-up for those who couldn't find a topic they liked. It's most likely due to a lack of experience or information.

## ü§îWhat about archiving?

This project will be archived weekly due to copyright concerns. It does not encourage piracy; it's educational and allows testing without crossing the line.

## üëåThat's about it.

As it progresses, I will try my best to update and provide accurate guidance on things that others are struggling with or having problems with.

## ‚ùìFAQ

#### Q1 - Why aren't there more supported languages?


Well, Because this project has just started so yeah, It'll receive more translation.

#### Q2 - How long will it take for "this" guide to come?

If you believe that there isn't a guide you're looking for and notice that we haven't planned on making it, Then please suggest it at our GitHub discussion.

More questions will be added once problems are found with the guides.
